# Udacity Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree Program Project 1
# Build_My_World

## Introduction
This project includes create a simulation world, designing a robot, housing it inside the world.

Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.

3. Import your structure and two instances of your model inside an empty Gazebo World.
4. Import at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in your existing Gazebo world.
